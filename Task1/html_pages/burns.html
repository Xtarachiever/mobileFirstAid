        <p>
        When someone has a burn or scald, 
        Cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 20 minutes, or until the pain is relieved.
        Seek medical attention by calling the emergency number or visit the nearest health centre
        When coling the burns, carefully remove any piece of clothing unless attached to the skin.
        If you're cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people, be aware that it may cause hypothermia (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermia).
        Cover the burn loosely with cling film. If cling film isn't available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material. Do not wrap the burn tightly as swelling may lead to further injury.For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to remove the chemical.
        If possible, determine the cause of the injury.
        In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use.
        Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary.

                <h2 class="major">Treating major burns Until emergency help arrives:</h2>
                <p>Protect the burned person from further harm. If you can do so safely, make sure the person you're helping is not in contact with the source of the burn. For electrical burns, make sure the power source is off before you approach the burned person.
                    Make certain that the person burned is breathing. If needed, begin rescue breathing if you know how.
                    Remove jewelry, belts and other restrictive items, especially from around burned areas and the neck. Burned areas swell rapidly.
                    Cover the area of the burn. Use a cool, moist bandage or a clean cloth.
                    Don't immerse large severe burns in water. Doing so could cause a serious loss of body heat (hypothermia).
                    Elevate the burned area. Raise the wound above heart level, if possible.
                    Watch for signs of shock. Signs and symptoms include fainting, pale complexion or breathing in a notably shallow fashion.</p>

                Treating minor burns:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Cool the burn. Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water or apply a cool, wet compress until the pain eases.
Remove rings or other tight items from the burned area. Try to do this quickly and gently, before the area swells.
Don't break blisters. Fluid-filled blisters protect against infection. If a blister breaks, clean the area with water (mild soap is optional). Apply an antibiotic ointment. But if a rash appears, stop using the ointment.
Apply lotion. Once a burn is completely cooled, apply a lotion, such as one that contains aloe vera or a moisturizer. This helps prevent drying and provides relief.
Bandage the burn. Cover the burn with a sterile gauze bandage (not fluffy cotton). Wrap it loosely to avoid putting pressure on burned skin. Bandaging keeps air off the area, reduces pain and protects blistered skin.
If needed, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).
